#
# Given two binary strings, return their sum (also a binary string).
#
# The input strings are both non-empty and contains only characters 1 orÂ 0.
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: a = "11", b = "1"
# Output: "100"
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: a = "1010", b = "1011"
# Output: "10101"
#

class Solution:
    def addBinary(self, a: str, b: str) -> str:
        return bin(int(a, base=2) + int(b, base=2))[2:]
